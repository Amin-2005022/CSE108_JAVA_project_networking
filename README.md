# CSE108 Java Networking Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **CSE-108** course during **Level-2, Term-1** at **BUET**. The primary objective is to design and implement a networked application using Java, demonstrating practical applications of **Java networking concepts**, **client-server communication**, and **object-oriented programming principles** to build a functional and efficient system.

## Project Details
- **Development Duration:** 4 weeks
- **Collaboration:** Individual project
- **Programming Language:** Java

## Key Features
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Establishes a robust client-server model for network communication.
- **Multithreading:** Supports concurrent client connections through Java multithreading, enhancing scalability.
- **Information Sharing:** Enables seamless data transfer between clients and the server.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Provides immediate information updates across clients without necessitating page refreshes.
- **Hashing Mechanism:** Utilizes hashing to connect individual clients to the server, facilitating easy identification of message sources.
- **Modular Design:** Organized into distinct packages for common classes, client-side functions, and server-side functions, promoting maintainability and scalability.

## Repository Structure
The project's source code is organized into the following directories:
- **UI:** Contains the user interface components.
- **movie:** Manages movie-related data and functionalities.
- **server:** Handles server-side operations and client connections.
- **util:** Includes utility classes and helper functions.

Additionally, a `movies.txt` file serving as a data source for movie information.
